Write a program to input two integers A & B from user and print their HCF.

Definition Of HCF: The HCF(Highest Common Factor) or the GCD(greatest common divisor) of two positive integers happens to be the largest positive integer that 
divides the numbers without leaving a remainder.


public static void HCF(int a, int b){
    int  hcf = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= a || i <= b; i++) {
        if( a % i == 0 && b % i == 0 )
            hcf = i;
    }
    System.out.println(hcf);
}
