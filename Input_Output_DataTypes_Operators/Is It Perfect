Given the Number of Test Cases as T,
For each test case, take an integer N as input, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding the number itself). 
A positive proper divisor divides a number without leaving any remainder.

Input 1:
2
4
6

Output 1:
NO
YES 

Explanation 1:
For the first test case A = 4, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.
For the second test case A = 6, the answer is "YES" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6.

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    // Please take input and print output to standard input/output (stdin/stdout)
    // DO NOT USE ARGUMENTS FOR INPUTS
    // E.g. 'Scanner' for input & 'System.out' for output

    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int T = scn.nextInt();
    for(int i = 1 ; i <= T ; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        int input = scn.nextInt();
        for (int j = 1; j < input; j++) {
            if (input % j == 0) {
                sum = sum + j;
            }
        }
        if (sum == input) {
            System.out.println("YES");
        } else {
            System.out.println("NO");
        }
    }    
}
