Implement a program that takes two positive integers A and B in the input and prints their LCM.

Definition of LCM : The Least Common Multiple or LCM of two numbers say A and B, is denoted as LCM (A,B). 
And the LCM is the smallest or least positive integer that is divisible by both A and B

public static void LCM(int a, int b){
    int lcm = (a > b) ? a : b;
    while (true){
        if( lcm % a == 0 && lcm % b == 0 ) {
            System.out.println(lcm);
            break;
        }
        ++lcm;
    }
}
